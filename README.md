We all found several research papers to be used in the overall project, and created the methodology to be used. 
We meet around 2 hours a week. Normally on Tuesday between classes. We also talk everyday after class for roughly 20+ minutes regarding the project.

Gavin ~ Worked on creating the initial game with Annie, and uploaded the base code for the game to github. This included the click to start scene, and the scene that includes playable buttons and a fail state. Wrote some of the paper in checkpoint 1 towards final project.

Lindsey ~ Worked on the references, related works, and methodoly portion of the checkpoint paper. Wrote other areas of the project paper working toward the final project paper.

Annie  ~ Worked on creating the initial game with Gavin, and uploaded the base code the game to github. This included the click to start scene, and the scene that has playable buttons and a fail state. Wrote the introduction section of the paper, add some other things adding to the final project paper.

Logan ~ Created the initial github upload with the base project code for Unity, configured it to work properly with correct files. Tried to modify the colors and timing of the buttons in the game.

We will all be working toward performing the experiment. To do this, we need to finish implementing the game, and some ways to measure statistics from the game. Each person will be writing several more sections of the paper, and contributing to the paper overall. We'll continue meeting as we have been, most likely adding more meeting times to work as a team. Each person will be implementing a feature into the game. Logan will implement adding xbox controller support w/ vibrations, and sound cues.
