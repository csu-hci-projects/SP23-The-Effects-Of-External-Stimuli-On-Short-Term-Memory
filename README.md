We all found several research papers to be used in the overall project, and created the methodology to be used. 
We meet around 2 hours a week. Normally on Tuesday between classes. We also talk everyday after class for roughly 20+ minutes regarding the project.

Gavin ~ Worked on creating the initial game with Annie, and uploaded the base code for the game to github. This included the click to start scene, and the scene that includes playable buttons and a fail state. Wrote some of the paper in checkpoint 1 towards final project.

Lindsey ~ Worked on the references, related works, and methodoly portion of the checkpoint paper. Wrote other areas of the project paper working toward the final project paper.

Annie  ~ Worked on creating the initial game with Gavin, and uploaded the base code the game to github. This included the click to start scene, and the scene that has playable buttons and a fail state. Wrote the introduction section of the paper, add some other things adding to the final project paper.

Logan ~ Created the initial github upload with the base project code for Unity, configured it to work properly with correct files. Tried to modify the colors and timing of the buttons in the game.

We will all be working toward performing the experiment. To do this, we need to finish implementing the game, and some ways to measure statistics from the game. Each person will be writing several more sections of the paper, and contributing to the paper overall. We'll continue meeting as we have been, most likely adding more meeting times to work as a team. Each person will be implementing a feature into the game. Logan will implement adding xbox controller support w/ vibrations, and sound cues.

Gavin ~ Worked on adding sound complexity to our game with Annie and assited with game round functionality. Additionaly, made crucial edits to the general research paper and rewrote our groups introduction. Other than that I was around to help with any issues and found related works articles to meet the checkpoint 2 requirement.

Lindsey ~ Converted the original document into overleaf, fixing any and all issues and creating bibliography. Wrote the section "Vibration in gaming" which introduced 4 more peer review papers into our paper. Edited the whole paper with help from a non-CS student. Added the between mode button to separate when the prototype changes from mode to mode. Also helped figure out the vibration issues and helped debug code for different frequencies of vibration and debugged for writing to a file. Annie and I also created the video together. 

Annie  ~ Worked through the prototype for the majority of this checkpoint. Elevated the game from simplistic simon says to include all of our stimuli and allow for the program to work on its one once it has begun. Recorded audio clips and added them to the game as well as figured out the rumble functionality within the Xbox controller. Built and debuged connecting the buttons on the controller to the buttons on the screen. I also worked to develop the logic so that the game modes would switch automatically when within a participant's session. I also wrote and debugged the program that works to save the data from each participant and round to a file in order to take the load off the person running the experiment from having to keep track of it by hand. Throughout this section I was forced to learn Unity and become comfortable in an environement that I had never worked in before. I also went through the methodology section of the paper, changing details as well as writing section 3.3 which describes the layout of the simulation

Logan ~ Spent the majority of my time working towards added functionality in the prototype. Implemented a scoreManager.cs which allows for some tracking of data, this data is what ends up outputted to the file. Implemented the playerController.cs for gamepad support with the controller XYAB buttons that are now matched up to the colors on the screen, Annie and I worked on this implementation together when I was having some trouble, this took considerable time to map as its something I've never done before. Worked on implementing the rumbleManager.cs to add rumble functionality to the controller. Annie and I completed this initial implementation very early on, however, since we were using macs and apparently the implementation doesnt function properly on macs she had to continue playing with it after I had to stop. Eventually figuring that it wasnt the implementation but the our devices and Unity. Spent time in the library working on the program and developing new ideas to add complexity to our prototype after receiving checkpoint 1 feedback.
