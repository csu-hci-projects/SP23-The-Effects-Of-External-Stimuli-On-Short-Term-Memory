#### Lindsey's Contributions
Set up and managed the Overleaf project, Created all the data tables and figures in the Latex, Ran an Anova test on the data. In the paper Worked on the references, fixed any and all issues and creating bibliography, wrote the all but two subsections inside the related works section, wrote all but one subsection of the methodology section, created the entirety of the results section, wrote the entirety of the discussion section and edited the entire paper. For coding, I added a button between rounds for users to know when they are switching modes in the experiment, I also helped solve bugs in the code alongside Annie. Gathered atleast 10 participants for our study, helped run the experiment including working by myself. Helped with the videos needed for submission. 

#### Gavin's Contributions
Assisted in building the original prototype and added the sound functionality to the project. Addtionally, worked on many different sections of the paper including introduction, related works, and conclusion. Some of my other contributions were finding valuable related works research papers and assisting in creating our final submission videos. In addition to this I ran our experiment for participants and collected consent forms and demographic survey answers.
