#### Lindsey's Contributions
Set up and managed the Overleaf project, Created all the data tables and figures in the Latex, Ran an Anova test on the data. In the paper Worked on the references, fixed any and all issues and creating bibliography, wrote the all but two subsections inside the related works section, wrote all but one subsection of the methodology section, created the entirety of the results section, wrote the entirety of the discussion section and edited the entire paper. For coding, I added a button between rounds for users to know when they are switching modes in the experiment, I also helped solve bugs in the code alongside Annie. Gathered atleast 10 participants for our study, helped run the experiment including working by myself. Helped with the videos needed for submission. 

#### Gavin's Contributions
Assisted in building the original prototype and added the sound functionality to the project. Addtionally, worked on many different sections of the paper including introduction, related works, and conclusion. Some of my other contributions were finding valuable related works research papers and assisting in creating our final submission videos. In addition to this I ran our experiment for participants and collected consent forms and demographic survey answers. 

#### Annie's Contributions
Created and implemented the initial code base for our project and pushed it to Unity, this was the GameManager.cs. Contributed to this with Gavin. This includes the underlying code for our game, the round structure, and the way in which patterns are represented and stored, and then the participant has to follow that pattern. Implemented succes and failure states for the game in which a user fails to follow the pattern or succesfully follows the pattern. This underlying code that Gavin and Annie contributed to is the foundation for our research project and all code there after was added to. Contributed significantly to and fully implemented the RumbleManager.cs, PlayerController.cs, and DataToFile.cs. Worked in part with Logan initially on the PlayerController.cs and RumbleManager.cs. Worked with Lindsey to implement the between rounds button since the initial button implementation was already created in GameManager.cs. Finished the implementation and ensured the working functionality of them. Implemented the DataToFile.cs. Overall contributed significantly to the code base of the project and was continually helping to work on that area of the project. Also implemented parts of the paper including Abstract, some related works, and the methodology. Helped collect participant data during days that we were collecting data. Worked on finishing key areas of the project, this includes the final videos. Also created the checkpoint 2 video and helped whenever needed.

#### Logan's Contributions
Created the initial Unity project that was pushed to Github. After the initial section of the game was added to this worked on the RumbleManager.cs, PlayerController.cs, and ScoreManager.cs. These sections of the code took a long time to implement, hence Annie and I ended up working hand in hand for the Rumble support and controller support. Wrote the readme for checkpoint one and two. Adjusted the colors and way in which the on screen buttons and patterns were presented. Eliminated several oddities in the code when stuck on implementing the PlayerController. Helped collect participant data on two separate occasions, so was present during data collection for the majority of the participants we had. Sourced the initial controller for the project. After collecting participant data placed that in the github, analyzed the data and added it to an excel sheet for Lindsey. Worked on the paper a little, wrote the threats to validity section. Was present for anything related to the group, this includes meetings, and some of the final content for submission.
